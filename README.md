## PyBank
A Python script that analyzes sets of revenue data to calculate each of the following:
* The total number of months included in the dataset
* The total amount of revenue gained over the entire period
* The average change in revenue between months over the entire period
* The greatest increase in revenue (date and amount) over the entire period
* The greatest decrease in revenue (date and amount) over the entire period

The script prints the analysis to the terminal and exports a CSV file with the results.

## PyBoss
A Python script that imports employee data and converts employee records to the required format by doing the following:
* Splits the Name column into separate First Name and Last Name columns.
* Changes the DOB data into DD/MM/YYYY format.
* Changes the SSN data such that the first five numbers are hidden from view.
* Abbreviates the State data using the US postal code.

The script exports the data in the new format as a CSV file.
